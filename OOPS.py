1. Class
2. Object
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Encapsulation

1. Class
Class is a group of different types of variables and functions.

2. Object
Object is an instance of class.

3. Inheritance
Object of one class acquire the properties of object of another class is called inheritance.
Creating a new class from an existing class is called inheritance.

4. Polymorphism
One name multiple form.
2 types:
-Compile time polymorphism
    -Method overloading
    -When there is a more than one method in a single class having the same name but with different number of arguments
    - and their datatypes than it is called method overloading.
-Run time polymorphism
    -Method overriding
    -When there is a same method prototype in your both base class and derive class and if you call that method using
    - the object of derived class than only derived class method will be called. So you can say that method of derived
    - class overrides the method of base class.

5. Encapsulation
Binding a data and code into a single unit is called Encapsulation.
